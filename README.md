# QnDoptimiser
Quick and dirty optimiser for IT2AMK output.

Not really an optimiser as such, but can shrink the file significantly to make testing easier.

Usage: Drag-n-drop the MML file from the IT2AMK output folder on to QnDoptimiser.exe, or run "qndoptimiser (full path to file)" at the command prompt.
